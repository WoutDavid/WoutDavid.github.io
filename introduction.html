    In this project we will utilise the MOFA+ framework, which is an improved version of the formerly developed MOFA (Argelaguet, et al., 2020; Argelaguet, et al., 2018).
    The goal is to characterise the different factors that determine the brain cell phenotype both in mouse and in human and to examine whether there are factors that differ between the two species.
    The data that we will work on to research this are scRNA-sequencing (sequences RNA) and scATAC-sequencing (explores chromatin availability) results, which gives us both a genomic and an epigenomic layer to integrate.
