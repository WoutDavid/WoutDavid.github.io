    <h1>Gene set enrichment analysis</h1>
    <p>
        The idea in gene set enrichment analysis is to create a database of your genes of interest, and go over all linked GO (or other) annotations, 
        to see if there are any GO terms that come back more than generally expected. Thus if you perform this on the genes of factor 1 of your MOFA model, 
        you of course expect these genes to be important in describing the biological state of your cells, meaning every enriched pathway in these genes will hold 
        valuable information.
    <br>
        We performed this on the GO biological process datasets on both mouse and gene.
