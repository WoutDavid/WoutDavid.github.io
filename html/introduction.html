    <h1>Introduction to MOFA</h1>
        <h3>MOFA+</h3>
        Multi-Omics Factor Analysis is a model that provides a general framework for the integration of multi-omic datasets in an unsupervised manner, developed by Argelaguet et al. (2018 and 2020). 
        It can be viewed as a versatile and rigorous generalization of PCA, capable of inferring an interpretable, linearly-reduced, low dimensional representation in terms of a few latent factors that capture the driving sources of variation across all data modalities.
