        Multi-Omics Factor Analysis is a model that provides a general framework for the integration of multi-omic datasets in an unsupervised manner, developed by Argelaguet et al. (2018 and 2020). 
        It can be viewed as a versatile and rigorous generalization of PCA, capable of inferring an interpretable, linearly-reduced, low dimensional representation in terms of a few latent factors that capture the driving sources of variation across all data modalities.
        It assumes that your views(or data modalities) more or less share the same causes of variation, and thus draws strength from other data modalities to more accurately find features
        that explain most of the variation in the entire dataset. This is a critical point of the framework: the goals is not to find factors or features that explain differences between modalities or groups, 
        but to find those that explain most variation across the entire data, since it assumes it is all one entity.
